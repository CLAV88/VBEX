' General pattern is to have a property or method that applies to one
' element and then extend that to sequences.
'
' ### Access and Replace
'
' `Item` allows for access and replacement of an element through indexes.
' `Slice` extends that to sequences that allows reversing and steps. Only
' `Slice has steps, other sequence methods only apply to continuous sequences.
