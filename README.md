VBA Extension Library

Sister project to [VBAUnit](https://github.com/ckuhn203/VBAUnit). This is the Core Library where generally useful classes that are not directly related to testing are kept. This is a "toolbox" project to give a common home to useful VBA extensions. 

Currently, the most interesting and useful classes are the VBEditor (VBE) classes. These classes extend the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility library and require a reference to said library. These classes greatly ease the automation of inserting code modules and snippets.
